# Global GPS Pong

### Global GPS Pong.
### An invisible GPS coordinate ball travels at hundreds of miles an hour across your country.
### If it goes through your city and you're close enough, you can swing your phone at the right time to deflect it.
### If you swing too wildly, it might 'foul' and keep traveling mostly in the same direction.
### Also you can add spin to the ball if you have sideways motion to your phone swing.
### East vs. West coasts. You score a point for getting it in the opposite ocean. 
### Leaderboards with hits and goals. 
### Cross-country play?
